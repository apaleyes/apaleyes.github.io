						Hi! Thanks for the intro, it's great being here and presenting at this amazing seminar series.

						First off, credit where it's due. Everything we'll cover today is primarily the result of a work of these amazing people, whom I was fortunate enough to supervise at some point as students or interns.

					<p class="fragment">Sounds familiar?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Today we are going to talk about solid way of discovering and navigating trade-offs in ML models. If you are a regular of this seminar this may sound familiar to you.

							"Multi-Objective AutoML: Towards Accurate and Robust models", Jan van Rijn, AutoML seminar, 16 Oct 2025
						</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Indeed, just a few months ago Jan van Rijn gave a talk here about a trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Great talk, please check it out if you missed it, i think it greatly complements today's presentation.

					<h3>Today's highlights</h3>
					<p class="fragment">3 objectives: fairness, privacy, energy efficiency</p>
					<p class="fragment">Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation (MOBO)</p>
					<p class="fragment">Step-by-step guide!</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						But of course today's talk will be different. Here are the highlights. First, we'll talk not only about one objective, but three: fairness, privacy, energy efficiency. Second, we'll be using multi-objective Bayesian optimisation as the discovery mechanism. And third, in the end I will give you a step by step recipe that you can use to discover the trade-offs that matter the most in your context. This might include privacy, robustness, speed, or anything else you fancy.

					<h3>Two models dilemma</h3>
					<div class="container">
						<div class="col">
							<b>Model 1</b>
							<ul>
								<li>96% accuracy</li>
								<li>15 samples per juole</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<b>Model 2</b>
							<ul>
								<li>89% accuracy</li>
								<li>21 samples per juole</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's consider a situation. We have two models, one is a bit more accurate, another is more energy efficient. Which do you deploy? Which one is better?

						The right answer is "it depends". Depending on the circumstances, such as regulations, or customer requirements, or budgets, answer might be different. Which means it is crucial to have this sort of information readily at hand. Yet more often than not it is not available at all.
